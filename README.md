and expecially the containing Link list under

https://4hhmm.github.io/get-in-git-and-github-for-beginners/link-list.html#

and you are  leave me a comment here under gitHub > DISCUSSIONS ! 

I'm glad if it helps you too and gladly accept hints for further improvements. 

The size of the linklist, which has already exceeded the originally planned small --git and gitHub-- project, surprises me myself.
It will be structured better when the opportunity arises, as it is starting to get a bit confusing.

But up to date quality content always comes first!

Happy Coding!
